# SF Movie Map

Quick application to display all the movie locations in San Francisco. This dataset is pulled from [Data SF](https://datasf.org/opendata/). This was an evening 1-day hack. Things probably don't work that well :). Expect a URL soon.

Give it a good ol' `make` with ruby/docker installed and it should create a docker image to run the application.

Note, there are currently no tests, and some broken data, this was a quick hack one evening. I will maybe come back and fix all of this.
